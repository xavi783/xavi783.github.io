Hi there! I introduce myself, I'm a data scientist with more than 6 years of experience in finance, working in areas like risk evaluation, asset management and others. But I'm not only interested on financial areas, I also like data science in general and I'm involved in some related projects like kaggle competitions or IoT projects.

But this is not just a work, I'm also an enthusiast of robotics and I'm just working in a project with some colleagues. We are trying to develop an autonomous system based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino using mobile devices for control it. 

Finally, I'd like to talk about this web page, the aim of building this blog is to publish some interesting reflections about hacking, data science and similar technologic topics. If you want to suggest me some specific topics to talk about, you can contact me on social networks.

I hope you enjoy this blog.

Regards.
