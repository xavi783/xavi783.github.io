There are times in your life that the universe send you a message, of course its meaning depend on you and nobody else but it's a
message at the end which it's not to say so much, hehe.

That think came to my mind this week because there were a lot of things happening together but it's now when I start to think about what
they really mean.

Let's go one step at a time, what happended this week and how is related with the title of the post?. Well, all is about Japan, I have always ever been curious
about japanese culture, I love their honor and duty ideals, the way they think first about others to improve their own lives and eventually the whole japanese idiosyncrasy, in fact I'm starting to learn japanese.

The fact was, that I was talking with someone about my future plans and she told
me a word that I've never heard before, LEAN. What is LEAN?

The "LEAN" term was coined in Japan and it means do so much as possible with the minimum wasting of resources, in other words, it means to use just the necessary and
right tools to perform the work.

It sounds easy but it's not. First step is take the big picture and discard everything which is not necessary, so you must be prepared to throw away all useless things that you have been collecting over the years, then you have to classify what is really useful and what is not and  prepare the right place to get this things very accesible.

Once you have the right tools in the right place, the next step is improve your workflow. You must analyze what activities give you more value by the resources that they require and then must empower the more valuable activities and encourage all the people to follow that.

So I proposed myself to follow this method. I'll brief you about my progress ;)
