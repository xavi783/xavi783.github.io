New experiences in my live push me to write this post. Recently, I have had the chance of participate in the production of a short film called [Destinos](https://www.facebook.com/destinoscorto). I became executive producer of Destinos because of fate and this is the kind of things which make you think that all steps in your live have led you to this point.

All started when I met the project. I thought that the story had the neccesary strength to be a great story but the fate wanted the story wouldn't have been made before. In that moment, I didn't know how important would be this story in my life. Today, a few days after finished the filming. I have some reflections to make about all the things which this experience have teached me.

First, all is about people, No progress can be made if there aren't great people behind. It's something simple but we often forget how important the people are. Allow me to tell you something about the project, the filming took more than 12 hours per day and more than 5 days with a team around 25 people and all of them worked for free, without a single coin in their pockets at the end of the day and only one motivation: Making the best effort to get the best short film.

Some of you will say "Ey! This is not creativity, This is only hard work!", and yes, you're right but I believe that creativity is something that only can be realized with a great effort, so let's take a glance to the results and how these have been possible.

First of all we need the seed to get the tree, in this case the seed was a great story and eventually the promise of a great final product, to sum up the seed is **motivation**. You can`t be creative if you don't have enough motivation. But only motivation is just not enough.

A required ingredient for getting creativity is the excellence, In this case we had a great team where the people were excellent professionals in their respective fields and being excellent not only means to have enough knowledge about your work, it also means to have the right attitude, will and discipline to reach the desired final result, in other words, to get the reason of your motivation.

Till the moment, we have motivation and excellence as ingredients to get creativity, is there something else remaining? The answer is yes, there is something else. A challenge, we need to find a challenge to be able to develop our creativity. If you know everything which needs to be done then there's no place to creativity, it sounds very logical. In this case we had to pass through multiple challenges, the weather, lack of time to film, find the best way to express feelings... But the team had a great success, overcoming all the drawbacks, but how? the answer is easy again, They just used their creativity to find the best solution to all of this problems.

To sum up, it was made a great work thanks to people and their creativity, without enough money to pay them, only because they decided contribute with their creativity to this project. In this moment is when you realize of all the power of the people and their beliefs, the power to improve the world around us, the power of giving us amazing stories and this is the reason why I think that creativity and people is the engine for getting new and great things.
